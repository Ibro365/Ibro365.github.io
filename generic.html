									<h2>Geeazy Mobile App</h2>
									<p>For the capstone project, me and my group members decided to create a multi-platform mobile application for the company Geeazy.</p>
									<h2>Project Summary</h2>
									<p>Geeazy is a rating and review website for handymen and local contractors. They allow customers to search for handymen
									 and local contractors for services suiting their needs. This project we will be building multi-platform mobile application 
									 for the company Geeazy. This application will allow handymen to make a profile and list their experiences, skills, contact 
									 info and preferred locations to work. It allows users to search for skilled handymen and local contractors to hire for services
									like renovation, electrician, plumbing, painting, window cleaning, etc. This application will also help students look for part time 
									jobs by allowing students to message handymen and local contractors to get hired. Students can also make their own profile by listing 
									their experiences, skills and contact info to find individual part-time work. Users of the application can search for handymen and local 
									contractors for services suited to their needs and requirements. This allows the handymen to find work and the user to have their work done. 
									Handymen and Local contractors can build their profile and receive ratings and reviews. This will allow the handymen to update their profile 
									and look attractive to employers and allow users to know which handymen is best suited for their needs. </p>
									<h2>Project Vision</h2>
									<p>The vision that we have for this multi-platform mobile application is to expand the company Geeazy to reach more people. We want more
									people to benefit from the company’s services. By creating mobile application we make it easier and user friendly, so any user can access 
									the app easily on their phone. Some features that are in scope of the project are finding handymen and contractors, users can contact each 
									other easily, businesses get rates and reviews, handymen and local contractors can build there profiles and get credit in the communities. 
									The feature that is out of scope is the app does not provide transaction for customers. The business opportunity in this product is connecting 
									local contractors and handyman with communities and users. Businesses will get more customers and make more money, and users can find the Best 
									handyman or contractors. Both sides benefit from it and it will be a good opportunity for businesses and users.  </p>
									<h2>High level/Buisness Requirements</h2>
									<p>The Business requirements for this project are as follows. User provider(handyman) must receive notification regarding someone posting a project, User providers must be able to post their availabilities, User providers must receive notification if someone rates or reviews their work, User receiver must be registered before rating or commenting someone’s work.   </p>
									<h2>Project Plan</h2>
									<p>The first deliverable of this project is the authentication system. The application will provide a login and a register page for both customers and workers. From there the user can specify what category they fall under and build their profile from there. The second deliverable of this project is the map location/search locator functionality (still discussing whether or not this functionality will be implemented). Customers can search for handymen and contractors by either viewing the map page that shows the user if there are any workers available around them, or manually search for them by entering their profile name in the search bar. The third deliverable of this project is the upload project and acheivements functionality. Customers can specify their need by making a post describing what service they want and by adding images or videos to the post. Handymen and Contractors can post any good work they have done to impress customers and boost their credibility. The last deliverable of this project is the rating and review functionalities. Customers can rate and review workers on the job they have done for them. This way customers will have a better idea of who the best worker for their service is.  </p>
									<p>This project makes the following assumptions. We assume that the handymen and contractors that are using our application are using it honestly. Meaning they are who they say they are and are not lying to customers about their experiences, skill set, qualifications, etc. The internal dependencies for this project include the register page. In order for customers to find services or for handymen to find work, they must first register. Another internal dependency is the map search feature. In order for customers to use the map feature to see if there are any handymen around them, the handymen must first be comfortable with turning their location on. The external dependencies of this project include service providers not showing up to meetings and customers leaving unfair ratings and reviews.</p>
									<h2>Requirement Analysis and Design</h2>
									<p>The functional requirements for this project are as follows. Handymen should be able to register. Intruductions: In this feature handymen can register his/herself and use our platform. Inputs: Handymen should be able to enter all required fields in order to register. Processing: System should save the handymen as a registered user. Outputs: Handymen can login to the app. Error Handling: we will assign most of the register form as a requirement so they can put all their information to ignore a fake account.</p>
									<p>Another functional requirement is customers should be able to post a project. Instructions: In this feature customer can post a project or work and handymen can reach the customer and give their price. Inputs: Customer should be able to enter the project’s information as well as enter a picture (optional). Processing: System should save project information and notify specific handymen who are qualified for that project. Outputs: Handymen can bid on project and make a deal with the customer. Error Handling: Customer can post a fake project, but we will make sure to ask the right question and put some restriction to avoid that kind of problem. </p>
									<p>The last functional requirement is customers should be able to rate and review handymen. Instructions: In this feature customer can rate and review a handyman once he has done the job. Inpts: Customer should be able to rate a handyman from 1 to 5 stars and also write a review. Processing: System should save the rating and review of customer and rank the handymen based on their performance. Outputs: Handymen’s profile can be updated due to the rating and review from the customer. Error Handling: Customer can give non genuine rate and review we will do our best to ignore that by asking a bit more for their experience with the handymen. </p>
