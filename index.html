									<h2>My Biography</h2>
									<p>My name is Ibrahim Moallim-Ahmed. I am 21 years old and I was born and raised in Toronto.
									I live with both of my parents and 2 of my brothers. I am the 2nd eldest. I am a college student
									in my last semester in the T127 Computer Programmer Analyst Program in George Brown College.
									I first got into programming when I was in the 10th grade at my high school known as Riverdale Colliegiate Institute.
									At first i was not very interested and I only took the programming course to get an extra credit.
									However, as I remained in the course and increased my knowledge and seen myself improve and get better,
									I started to gain an interest and passion for programming. Unfortunatley, that was my only experience 
									with programming in high school due to me not pursuing it further in grade 11 and 12. During the time when
									I had to decide what I wanted to do after high school, I was presented with many options and at first I decided
									to apply to a fire fighter program at Seneca because that was also a field I was interested in at the time. 
									However, it did not work out as I just did not see any future in it for me due to how competitve the field is and 
									the lack of jobs at the time. After that process was over my mother recommended that i apply to a computer programmer 
									program and that's when I remembered how I used to enjoy programming in grade 10 and I had some experience with it. That was when I decided to apply to the Computer Programmer Analyst program at George Brown. Thank you for taking the time to read! </p>
									<h2>Philosophy and Career Goal</h2>
									<p>I am a big believer in truthfullness and consistency. I believe that as long as you stay truthfull and consistent to whatever it is you commit yourself to, you will ultimatley succeed in it. In my first year of college I struggled a lot and did not perform well, 
									this was due to a lack of discipline and consistency in my school work. This caused me to feel very discouraged and want to give up. However, I decided to stick with it and by the time my second year came I improved a lot and started to feel excited about my school work again. Now in my current year i'm doing better than ever and I made the dean's list in the 5th semester. Some future ambitions I have is to land a mobile developer job and create and design meaningful applications that serves people in a positive way.</p>
									<h2>Academic Credintials</h2>
									<p>Upon successful completion of the IT Essentials course I took in my second semester. I recieved a A++ Certificate. I also made it into the dean's list in my 5th semester. Below is a screenshot of the email George Brown sent me regarding the achievement.</p>
